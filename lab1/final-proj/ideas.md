# Potential Project Ideas

## Stuck?
*Here are some suggestions*

If you're totally stuck, it can help to think through your answers to the following questions.

What categories of stuff are you interested in? Machine learning? Sports? Food? Fashion? Music? Dev tools? Photography? Healthcare? Social media? Video games? Sleeping? Board games? Theater? Biophysics? Algorithms? Systems? Automation? AI? etc.

What data is available? Census data? Genome data? API data? Survey data? etc.

What problems do you care about? Healthcare? Food insecurity? Education? Climate change? Divestment? Mental health? Politics? etc.

You can do almost anything you would like to!

## Random Ideas
*Miscellaneous ideas that we thought of over the course of the quarter.*

* 2-Step Auto-Authenicator - who needs security? automatically 2-step-authenticate all messages from a certain sender.
* Pizza Button - a hardware button that when pressed will use my credit card info to deliver Domino's directly to the dorm room.
* paperless.py - clone and update Paperless so that it can support CS41 (way out of scope for this class but a person can dream)
* canvasdav - a WebDAV client for Canvas (Coursework had one, Canvas doesn't) for local filesystem-like mounting of Canvas materials
* astparse - check for similarity between python code by looking at the ASTs
* piazzAI - a piazza client that answers common questions by using a hand-selected bank of information about the course or by learning based off of other student/TA answers
* stamp - convert spotify playlists to apple music playlists and back
* herowid - using the erowid database, a huge set of experiences of people on a variety of illegal drugs, classify a person's substance abuse based on their speech or text patterns
* xl2py - an excel spreadsheet to python converter, with reference resolution and everything
* facegraph - scrape all facebook chats with a given person and generate visualizations and analytics of your lifetime conversation
* quarto AI - AI to play a hyper-tic-tac-toe game
* codenames AI - AI using NLP to suggest a clue that is very similar to one set of words but very different from another set of words
* wireframe visualizer - build a project that visualizes 3D graphics using raytracing
* convex optimizer - generic convex optimizations on sufficiently constrained problems

## Previous Proposals
*List of proposals from last quarter's final projects. This list exists to show you the incredible breadth of projects that are possible!*

* Bach - Programming a Python-based piano interface with various musical capabilities.
* NoNonsense.py - scrape the genome of a new organism and return all the genes that will need to be changed, as well as all suggested primers to design to convert this to a viable system for nonsense suppression.
* TeaWithStrangers - When given a group of people and their survey answers, the program will output clusters of people based on common interests with optimized probability of great conversations and new friendships.
* RaspiTrack.py - Implementing a small number of computer vision algorithms in Python using a Raspberry Pi and a RPi Camera module, specifically focused on detecting circular objects, including edge-detection (Canny), k-means, and blob detection.
* Tweet Analyzer - scrapes Tweets based on a hashtag and performs sentiment analysis
* Hearts - Programming a Python-based interface for the game Hearts.
* Kaggle.py - Participate in a Kaggle competition using Python
* Juke - desktop jukebox application, allowing a user to create a playlist then people in proximity will be able to queue songs from their laptops onto the playlist
* Fantasy Football Trade Generator - propose mutually beneficial trades between teams in any fantasy football league. 
* Dexcom Data Visualizer - suite that parses Dexcom data to create useful visualizations and metrics using Python.
* MashedHeadlines.py - Twitter bot that will mash together two headlines and tweet them every hour
* Random Rapper - version of the random writer project from CS106B that scrapes rap lyrics from the lyrics website Genius.com to generate random, rap-like output.

## Ex-Assignments
*These projects were barely cut from being CS41 assignments. With some modification, they could be good final projects!*

* Ghost AI - build an AI for the popular word game Ghost, where players sequentially add a character to a growing prefix, losing if they spell a full word or if the current string is not a valid prefix of any word. 


## Stolen Assignments
*Implementations of programming assignments from other classes, this time in Python!*

* Karel (CS106A)- build a Karel emulator in Python, including a graphical interface, a lexer and parser for the karel language, and enforce correctness)
* RSS Aggregator (CS110) - aggregates news from lots of RSS feeds

## Past Assignments
*Some full-fledged assignments from previous quarters!*

* [AI Racecar](https://github.com/parthsarin/AIRacetrackGame)
* [PyTri : Python Image Triangulation](https://github.com/pmaldonado/PyTri)

## Credit
This handout was used in prior versions of CS 41, where it was unattributed to any individual person. Context suggests that it was a pool of ideas from a bunch of former CS 41 Course Staff. Moving forward, this document will function in that way: as a collection of project ideas from all staff members.
